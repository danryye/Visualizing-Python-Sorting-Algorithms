# Visualizing-Python-Sorting-Algorithms
This program gives a visual representation of how sorting algorithms work. 
It will create a plot with unsorted data and make copies of each frame as it sorts the data into order. 
Then an animation is generated to go through each frame to visual show how data was moved around during the sorting process. 
The program will also keep track of the nuber of times the array of data has been accessed, giving the user an idea of the efficiency of the sorting algorithm being performed.  

Dependencies: matplotlib, numpy
